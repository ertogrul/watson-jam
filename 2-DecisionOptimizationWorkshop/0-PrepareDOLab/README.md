Before playing with Decision Optimization you need to prepare the environment on IBM Cloud. Check the following instructions.  
  
  
# Task 1. IBM Cloud registration  
  
All labs are executed on the **IBM Cloud**, and prerequisites are:  
  
- [ ] You should have **1 valid email**   
  
- [ ] Sign up to the **IBM Cloud**   
  

**If you already have an IBM id, go to Task 2 of this script.**  
  
If you don't have a valid email address that you could use for cloud registration please use a temporary email service, like this: https://temp-mail.org/en/  
The temp-mail web site (shown below) will give you a temporary email address for 10 minutes. You can use this temporaty email address just to register to IBM Cloud.
