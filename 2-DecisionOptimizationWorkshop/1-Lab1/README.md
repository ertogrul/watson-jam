> IMPORTANT: The most important thing for you right now is to take your time and do not rush through the scripts. Rather, try to understand new concepts and let them sink in. You can finish the lab during the workshop but if you don't it's perfectly OK. 

Meet Max :) Max is attending Cake Competition and he wants to win!
He can eat tortes that take 2 minutes to eat or apple pies that take 3 minutes to eat. For one torte Max will get 4 points and for one apple pie - 5 points. 
Now think about what decision variables you would create. Then think about contraints and write down your thoughts. After that just download jupyter notebook and see how it's implemented in the code.

Task 1. Create a project in Watson Studio 

Task 2. Use option 'Add to project', then select option 'from file' and use notebook from link below.
