# Task 1. Run Reinforcement Learning model on Watson Studio  
  
Prerequisites for this lab are:

- [ ] Existing **IBM Cloud** account   
  
- [ ] Started instance of **Watson Studio** on your **IBM Cloud** account   
  
- [ ] One of two notebooks with Reinforcement Learning model: 

    + This option requires two files: [Pacman notebook](../../code/pacman.ipynb), [Pacman aux file](../../code/pacman.h5)

    + [Space Invaders notebook](../../code/space_invaders.ipynb)  



Reinforcement Learning is fast growing area of research. It also gains more and more use cases. If you want to know more, go here  [here](https://medium.com/ibm-data-ai/reinforcement-learning-the-business-use-case-part-1-65976c745319)  


Create new project in Watson Studio or open existing one. Click 'Add to Project' button.
