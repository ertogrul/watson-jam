Meet Max :) Max is attending Cake Competition and he wants to win!
He can choose tortes that take 2 minutes to consume or apple pies (3 minutes to eat one). For one torte Max will get 4 points and for one apple pie - 5 points. 
Now think about what decision variables you could create. Then think about contraints and write down your thoughts. After that just download jupyter notebook and see how the problem is solved.

Task 1. Create a project in Watson Studio 

Task 2. Use option 'Add to project', then select option 'from file' and use notebook from link below.

  + [Cake Competition notebook](../../code/Cake Competition Problem.ipynb)

Task 3. Run Jupyter Notebook file in Watson Studio and analyze the outcome. Try to change decision variables or minutes needed to eat torte of apple pie. See how it influences result.
