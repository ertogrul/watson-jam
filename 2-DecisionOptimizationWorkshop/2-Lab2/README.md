> IMPORTANT: The most important thing for you right now is to take your time and do not rush through the scripts. Rather, try to understand new concepts and let them sink in. You can finish the lab during the workshop but if you don't it's perfectly OK. 


So you are running a pasta factory. Your case is a little more complicated right now. You've got 3 products (kluski, capellinin, and fettucine) and each of those can be produced internally or outsourced. On top of that you've got specific orders (demand) for each of your three products. As you get to code try to play a little bit with all these variables and see how different scenarios are created for producing kluski, fettucine and capplelini with the least cost possible.  

Task 1. Create a project in Watson Studio 

Task 2. Use option 'Add to project', then select option 'from file' and use notebook from link below.

Task 3. Run Jupyter Notebook file in Watson Studio and analyze the outcome. Try to change decision variables or minutes needed to eat torte of apple pie. See how it influences result.
