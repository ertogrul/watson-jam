> IMPORTANT: The most important thing for you right now is to take your time and do not rush through the scripts. Rather, try to understand new concepts and let them sink in. You can finish the lab during the workshop but if you don't it's totally OK. You will be able to finish it later.  You can also continue with other labs that you find on the way. This is how any skill is built - by doing.   
    
      
# Task 1. Run Reinforcement Learning model on Watson Studio  
  
Prerequisites for this lab are:

- [ ] Existing **IBM Cloud** account   
  
- [ ] Started instance of **Watson Studio** on your **IBM Cloud** account   
  
- [ ] Notebook with Reinforcement Learning model that you can download here: [Space Invaders notebook](../../code/space_invaders.ipynb)  

- [ ] Another fun reinforcement learning model (playing Pacman) is here: [Pacman notebook](../../code/pacman.ipynb),  [Pacman aux file](../../code/pacman.h5) 


Reinforcement Learning is fast growing area of algorithms. If you want to know more about how it can be used, go here  [here](https://medium.com/ibm-data-ai/reinforcement-learning-the-business-use-case-part-1-65976c745319)  

  
> If you haven't registered to IBM Cloud or haven't started Watson Studio intance, please proceed to Preparation Lab.  
  

Create new project in Watson Studio or open existing one. Click 'Add to Project' button.
